Neptune 14 moons: Triton, Nereid, Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, ...

<<<<<<< HEAD
The planets equatorial clouds take 18 hours to complete one rotation. The
reason this happens is that Neptune does not have a solid body.

Triton is the largest moon of Neptune. It was probably named for the same
Roman demigod referenced in the Disney version of The Little Mermaid.
